    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This kebab sandwich is my version of Turkish kebabs, which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online. The original sandwiches are made from meat pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit.</p>
    <p>The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and put into a pita sandwich. My recipe calls for thin slices of meat to be marinated and then broiled to get the same effect without a huge rotating grill. Serve in a warmed pita with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pepperoncini.</p>
